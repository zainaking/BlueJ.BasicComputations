# Integer Printer

* Write a program that reads an integer and prints it in :
1. binary
2. Octal
3. Hexadecimal


# Normalize Angle
* Write a program that reads an integer angle (which may be positive or negative) and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. Try it first with the % operator, then with floorMod.


# Largest Integer

* Using only the conditional operator, write a program that reads three integers and prints the largest. Repeat with Math.max


# Factorial

* Write a program that computes the factorial n! = 1 x 2 x ... x n, using BigInteger. Compute the factorial of 1000.


# ShortValues
